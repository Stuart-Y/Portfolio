<h1>About</h1>
<p>I am a student that seeks after a broad range of topics. In addition to my computer experience, I have studied, biology,
physics, and several varieties of mathematics. I have also had many musical opportunities in my life between piano, woodwind, 
and choral experiences. I appreciate learning and finding new connections. </p>
